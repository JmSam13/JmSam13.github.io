	<p> Building gunpla is hard, but not impossible. Everything starts from choosing a kit, then building it. </p>
	<p>You can build your kits however you want, straight out of the box, maybe add some panel lines or cool stickers, you can also apply different types of coating and paints.
	Gunpla is freedom, don't get caught up in how people build their kits, and start building your own kits the way you want to. </p>
	<p> For beginners or first time builders, you may need </p>
	<ul>
	 <li> Plastic nippers </li>
	 <li> Tweezers </li>
	 <li> Hobby Knife (optional) </li>
	 <li> Markers (optional) </li>
	</ul>
	<p> to help you build your kit efficiently </p>
	<p> For beginners, i recommend building a few <a href=https://www.hlj.com/search/?q=*&productFilter=category%3AGundam%3B%3BitemType%3AHigh-Grade%20Kits%3B%3BitemType%3AHigh%20Grade%20Kits> HG kits</a> to get used to the process and build up confidence. </p>
    <h2> Building your kit </h2>
	<img src="images/manual.jpg" alt="Instruction-manual-for-the-MG-1/100-Gundam-NT-1-(ALEX)Ver.-2.0.jpg">
	<p> After picking a kit, begin by sorting the runners, typically labeled with letters and numbers, alphabetically or however you want to. Then open the instruction manual that comes with the kit, and follow the instructions; cut the pieces out with your nipper, remove nubs with your hobby knife and sandpaper, then piece them together based on the manual. </p>
	<p> You can add some finishing touches by sticking the stickers or decals that comes with the kit, add some panel lines here and there to make the kit pop, remove seam lines, or change the color scheme with some paint or by using <a href="https://www.hlj.com/search/?q=gundam+marker">gundam markers</a>. </p>
